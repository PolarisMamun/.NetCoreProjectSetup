//To Scaffolding in controller folder click on right button and add a controller select API controller with action,using entity framework then chose model class,dbcontext class ,and controller name


//In the context of .NET and web development, "scaffolding" generally refers to the automatic generation of code and files for common tasks in building a web application, particularly in the context of web APIs. 
Scaffolding is a code generation technique that helps developers quickly create the basic structure and functionality of certain components, such as controllers, views, models, and other artifacts.


  Key Terms and Definitions
Our scaffolded code features some keywords that are defined below for full understanding.

Task - A task in C# is used to implement Task-based Asynchronous Programming. The Task object is typically executed asynchronously 
  on a thread pool thread rather than synchronously on the main thread of the application.

async - Signals to the compiler that this method contains an await statement; it contains asynchronous operations.

await - The await keyword provides a non-blocking way to start a task, then continue execution when that task completes.

ActionResult - An action is capable of returning a specific data type (see WeatherForecastController action).  When multiple return types are possible, 
  it's common to return ActionResult, IActionResult or ActionResult<T>, where T represents the data type to be returned.
